# BMI Calculator - Group Work

## 📱 Project Description
This project is an Android mobile application designed to calculate a user's **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on their weight and height. It serves as a simple health monitoring tool that provides immediate feedback on whether a user's weight falls within a healthy range.

The application implements the standard BMI formula (BMI = weight / height * height) and classifies the result into four categories based on WHO standards: **Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese**.

## ✨ Key Features
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple `EditText` fields for entering weight (in kg) and height (in meters) with numeric keypad restrictions.
* **Robust Validation:** Prevents crashes by checking for empty inputs and invalid numeric characters before calculation.
* **Real-time Classification:** Automatically categorizes the calculated BMI into health ranges (e.g., *Overweight* if BMI is between 25.0 – 29.9).
* **Reset Functionality:** A dedicated button to clear all fields and results instantly for a fresh calculation.
* **Formatted Output:** Results are displayed clearly with 2 decimal precision.
